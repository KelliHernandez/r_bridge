The good folks over at RStudio (I know! It sounds like we're schilling for them!) maintain a set of resources that they describe as "Cheatsheets". They are sort of the equivalent of the note cards that you brought into physics exams in college. 

- The top-level repository with the cheatsheets is [here](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).
- The cheatsheet that is specifically useful right now is the [Rmarkdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf). (Note, this link might download a PDF when you click it.)  
Blank Code (to be replaced when class is executed) for rstudio_cheatsheet.md
